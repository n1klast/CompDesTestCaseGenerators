# CompDesTestCaseGenerators
 <pre>
Assignment 1: It prints the resulting expression after the optimization (using your implemented string_of function).  <br />
              Make sure your interpreter works correctly before executing the following tests:  
                    case*.4.5 tests whether or not the optimized version still evaluates to the same as the non optimized version    
                    case*.5 tests whether or not the compiler is correct (according to the task)   <br />
              How to:  
                     1. Adjust Arguments if you want:   -a different difficulty 
                                                        -more/less test cases  
                                                        -stop the .txt file creation
                                                        -only specific task 
                                                        -(not recommended) change depths for the difficulties  
                     2. copy the first line (let testctxt...) above the provided_tests function in providedtests.ml  
                     3. copy the rest (from " Test ("Testcases++"..." on) into the provided_tests function underneath the already existing test  
                     4. Run
